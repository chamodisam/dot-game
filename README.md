# Connect Four Game (React)

This is a Connect Four game built using React JS. Players alternate turns to drop tokens into a grid, with the objective of connecting four of their tokens in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Players take turns dropping tokens into the grid.

- Winner detection: The game detects when a player connects four tokens in a row, column, or diagonal.

- Game reset: After a winner is determined, the game can be reset for a new round.

- Responsive design: The game is responsive and works on different screen sizes.
